# Roadmap Migration

Roadmap items are now stored directly in Supabase, so migrating from local Markdown files is no longer required. The previous `scripts/migrate-roadmap.ts` helper has been removed.

Existing projects should already have their roadmap data in Supabase. No additional steps are necessary.
