# Repository Guidelines

- Do not create, edit, or delete `roadmap/vision.md`.
- A pre-commit hook in `.githooks/pre-commit` prevents commits that modify this file. Ensure your local `core.hooksPath` is set to `.githooks` so the hook runs.
- Run `npm test` and `npm run check` before submitting changes.
