# PIM Development Roadmap

## Vision

A modern Product Information Management (PIM) platform centralizes product data,
supports omnichannel distribution and enables teams to collaborate efficiently.
The long‑term goal is a scalable, extensible system comparable to
[Bluestone PIM](https://help.bluestonepim.com/1-get-started-with-bluestone-pim)
and [Akeneo](https://help.akeneo.com/serenity).

## Development Tasks

### 1. Core PIM Foundation

- Design database schema for products, categories, attributes, variants and media
  with versioning/audit tables.
- Expose CRUD APIs for all core entities (REST + GraphQL).
- Build minimal admin UI: product list, product detail editor and attribute
  groups.
- Include basic unit tests for APIs and UI components.

### 2. Enrichment & Workflow

- Implement enrichment dashboard showing completeness per channel/locale.
- Support bulk editing and validation rules for required attributes.
- Add localization with translation service integration.
- Provide workflow states (draft → review → approved → published).

### 3. Import/Export & Integration

- Create CSV/Excel import pipeline with mapping and error reporting.
- Build connector framework for channel exports (eCommerce platforms,
  marketplaces, print).
- Deliver event driven updates via webhooks.
- Harden public APIs for third‑party consumption.

### 4. Advanced Capabilities

- Add DAM module for managing and transforming assets.
- Support product relationships (bundles, accessories, replacements).
- Introduce AI‑assisted enrichment such as automatic descriptions and
  categorization.
- Enhance search with facets, synonyms and suggestions.

### 5. Governance & Scale

- Implement RBAC with fine‑grained permissions and SSO support.
- Provide audit logging for user actions and API calls.
- Add monitoring, backups and horizontal scaling strategy.

## Success Metrics

- Data completeness and validation error rates.
- Time‑to‑market for new products.
- Adoption of channels/locales and workflow efficiency.
