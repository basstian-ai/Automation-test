# PIM Development Roadmap

## Vision
A modern Product Information Management platform centralizes product data, supports omnichannel distribution and enables teams to collaborate efficiently. The long‑term goal is a scalable, extensible system comparable to [Bluestone PIM](https://help.bluestonepim.com/1-get-started-with-bluestone-pim) and [Akeneo](https://help.akeneo.com/serenity).

## Development Tasks

### 1. Dashboard & Admin Interface (Immediate Priority)
- Build an interactive dashboard showing product counts, enrichment status and recent activity.
- Implement a responsive admin panel with product list, search/filter, and a tabbed product detail editor.
- Provide inline editing, variant management and attribute grouping.
- Deliver navigation, breadcrumbs and user-friendly layouts across desktop and mobile.

### 2. Sample Product Data & Examples (Immediate Priority)
- Create a realistic sample dataset with categories, attributes, variants and media.
- Use this dataset in documentation, tests and UI examples.
- Provide scripts to import/export the sample data.

### 3. Core PIM Foundation
- Design database schema for products, categories, attributes, variants and media with versioning/audit tables.
- Expose CRUD APIs for all core entities (REST and GraphQL).
- Include basic unit tests for APIs and core services.

### 4. Enrichment & Workflow
- Implement enrichment dashboard showing completeness per channel/locale.
- Support bulk editing and validation rules for required attributes.
- Add localization with translation service integration.
- Provide workflow states (draft → review → approved → published) with transition rules.

### 5. Import/Export & Integration
- Create CSV/Excel import pipeline with mapping and error reporting.
- Build connector framework for channel exports (eCommerce platforms, marketplaces, print).
- Deliver event-driven updates via webhooks.
- Harden public APIs for third‑party consumption.

### 6. Advanced Capabilities
- Add DAM module for managing and transforming assets.
- Support product relationships (bundles, accessories, replacements).
- Introduce AI‑assisted enrichment such as automatic descriptions and categorization.
- Enhance search with facets, synonyms and suggestions.

### 7. Governance & Scale
- Implement RBAC with fine‑grained permissions and SSO support.
- Provide audit logging for user actions and API calls.
- Add monitoring, backups and horizontal scaling strategy.

## Success Metrics
- Data completeness and validation error rates.
- Time‑to‑market for new products.
- Adoption of channels/locales and workflow efficiency.
